Feature: Login
  As a member of the Berkeley Food Collective
  I want to be able to type in my email and click on the login button
  So that I can login to the application

  Background: Database is loaded with test users
    Given the following users in the database
      | name             | email                     |
      | Roberto Cardenas | robertocardenas@bsfc.coop |
      | Andrew Mo        | andrewmo@bsfc.coop        |

    And the default settings
    When I start on the login page

  Scenario: User inputs an email that is in the database
    When I fill in "session_email" with "robertocardenas@bsfc.coop"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see "Announcements"


  Scenario: User inputs an email that is not in the database
    When I fill in "session_email" with "roberto@roberto.com"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see "Please enter a valid email address!"

  Scenario: User inputs an inactive email
    Given the following users in the database
      | name           | email              | active |
      | Inactive Nancy | inactive@email.com | false  | 

    When I fill in "session_email" with "inactive@email.com"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see "Please enter a valid email address!"
